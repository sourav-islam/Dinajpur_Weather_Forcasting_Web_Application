## Objective:

Develop a **weather forecasting application** that provides users with accurate and up-to-date weather information for a given location. The application should include features such as current weather conditions, hourly and daily forecasts, and weather alerts.

## Proposed SDLC Model: Agile

## Reasoning:

**Agile** is a suitable SDLC model for the Weather Forecasting Application because weather data and user requirements can change rapidly. Agile's iterative and flexible approach allows for continuous adaptation to evolving conditions, ensuring that the application remains relevant and reliable.

### Agile SDLC Phases for Weather Forecasting Application:

### 1. Requirements/Project Planning :

➡ Define the geographical division for weather forecasting.  
➡ Identify the essential weather parameters to display (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).  
➡ Create a backlog with user stories, such as fetching weather data, designing a user-friendly interface, and implementing responsive web design.

#### Likely include following parameters

</p>

### 2. Sprint Planning:

➡ Break down user stories into tasks for each sprint.  
➡Plan short sprints (e.g., 2 weeks) to focus on specific aspects of the application.  
➡Prioritize tasks based on their importance and dependencies.

### 3. Implementation (Sprints):

➡Develop the core functionality to fetch and display real-time weather data for the specified division.  
➡Implement a responsive web design to ensure usability on various devices.  
➡Iteratively add features like daily forecasts, weather maps, or user preferences in subsequent sprints.

### 4. Testing:

➡Conduct regular testing for the accuracy of weather data.  
➡Perform usability testing to ensure an intuitive user interface.  
➡Implement automated tests for critical functionalities.

### 5. Deployment Phase:

➡Review implemented features at the end of each sprint with stakeholders.  
➡Conduct retrospectives to identify improvements in the development process and address any challenges.

### 6. Release and Maintenance :

➡Release updates at the end of each sprint with new features or improvements.  
➡Gather user feedback and make adjustments based on user experience.  
➡Monitor and update weather data sources for accuracy.  
➡Address any reported bugs promptly.  
➡Consider adding new features based on user feedback or emerging technologies.
